# Recolor v.2.0.0

WIP!

This is a simple recoloring tool. It takes in input multiples images with a similar
palette and simply change each color to another on every images.

This project was made to help a friend recoloring multiple frames of a sprite
at once.

# Old version

The old version of the application is still available if you rewind to the 2nd
commit and shouldn't have too much troubles to work.
